This is a personal learning project for the purpose of learning React.js + redux.js.
It is a web application that allows user to register/login, customise and order burgers online.
You could view and try this app online at https://burger-builder-d60fd.web.app/.

The application is built with create-react-app.
If you would like to try this app locally, enter "npm install" on the command line after you download the files.
Then start the application by "npm start".

This project is built with react and redux. It is fully functional components based using the latest react.js hooks(16.9.0).
It is connected to firebase real-time database. All the authentication is handled by firebase.

THE COTRIBUTION FOR THIS PROJECT IS A BIT OFF BECAUSE I FORGOT TO SET UP LOCAL GIT EMAIL....
